1. Select the customers whose total turnover (the sum of all orders) exceeds a certain value.

2. For each customer make a list of suppliers located in the same country and the same city. Compose queries with and without grouping.

3. Find all customers with the sum of all orders that exceed a certain value.

4. Select the clients, including the date of their first order.

5. Repeat the previous query but order the result by year, month, turnover (descending) and customer name.

      <li>undefined region</li>
      <li>operator code in the phone is not specified (does not contain parentheses)</li>
    </ol>

7. Group the products by category, then by availability in stock with ordering by cost.

      <li>From cheap exclusive to average inclusive</li>
      <li>From average exclusive to expensive inclusive</li>
    </ol>
